===========

The course description is now incorporated in the book itself.
From 2015.06.22-27_Trieste onwards.
Not sure I will continue to develop as a stand alone document.
Included in git repository, but probably will remain static.

On the other hand ... why would I not need a separate document?
Anyway, the intial version (current as of this date) is archived
with Oeiras 2015.04

If I understand how git works, will not, generally, need to
archived again? Probably will though :-)

The course description is now incorporated in the book itself.
From 2015.06.22-27_Trieste onwards.
Not sure I will continue to develop as a stand alone document.
Included in git repository, but probably will remain static.

On the other hand ... why would I not need a separate document?
Anyway, the intial version (current as of this date) is archived
with Oeiras 2015.04

If I understand how git works, will not, generally, need to
archived again? Probably will though :-)

Whilst I struggle for a decision of the deep self discussion above,
I decide to update this to make it agree with the version
incorporated in the book itself.

Maybe I should maintain a separate document on the grounds I might
want to just use a desciption of the intent, without the content?

OK, but these notes are redundant as they would be incorporated in
the commit notes of GIT.

Yep, think that is the future ... except, I would not genarally 
update this document each time I update BOM? So ... here I should
just make a note .. maybe ... ?

Hell! I dunno ... I will update if and when I feel like it. Yep,
that works .. for now ..

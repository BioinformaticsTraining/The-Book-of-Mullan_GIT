# The-Book-of-Mullan
## Training Manual for my Basic Introduction to Bioinformatics

Born in the late 1980s, when the earth was still cooling.
Tempered in the white spirit, brown beers, multi hued vinos and other mistakes of the 1990s.
Tamed and beaten into the quivering submission by "The Mullan" in the early 2000s.
Nutured and tenderly stroked passed its natural date of demise by me since dear Lisa decided to dedicate herself to procriation and othe womanly pursuits (Circa 2004).
Contributions from very many persons, mostly employees of the sadly missed HGMP Resource Centre (1990-2004 approximately). Not sure if they would wish to be mentioned, or would prefer that there involvement remained anonymous? Sure they will let me know if they feel concern.

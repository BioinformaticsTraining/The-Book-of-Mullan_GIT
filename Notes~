===========

bin:
   A directory with scripts and reminders to help me do
   all this GIT stuff without constantly reading the manual.

Course_Description:
   A stand alone ersion of the Course Description now
   incorporated in the BOM.

Windows_Installer:
   An empty directory. Logically it should hold the installer
   for all required Windows software. Currently this is far
   too big and slow developing to put here. In the future,
   maybe it will not be needed at all, or I will create a
   more manageable version. Not much now needs to be
   installed. I aim to use web resources exclusively in
   future, if possible.

Participant_Desktop:
   Files to be set up on a participant's Desktop at the
   start of the course.
    - Working_Directory: (Start up files not obtainable
      from real databases, currently just pax6_cdna.fasta)
    - The BOM PDF file
    - Backup_Files: A directory containing all the result
      files required to enable a participnat to skip any
      part of the exercises and still have all the
      required data to continue.

Sandbox:
      A directory in which to do the exercises when
      updating the BOM. I propose to save each version
      with the most relevant course records.

The_Book:
      Latest BOM.odt. Plus a copy of the latest PDF?
